**Go IR Interpreter — Undefined Behavior Detection for Go**

Giri interprets Go programs via SSA (Static Single Assignment) form and validates every memory operation against a shadow memory system. It catches classes of bugs that the Go compiler, `go vet`, `-race`, and static analyzers miss.

Named after [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) (MIR Interpreter for Rust), Giri fills the same role for Go: an interpretive runtime verifier that understands your program's memory semantics.

## What It Detects

| Category | Example | go vet | -race |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arena use-after-free | Access arena memory after `Free()` | — | — |
| Arena pointer escapes | Return/channel/global arena pointers | — | — |
| Arena leaks | Forgotten `Free()` | — | — |
| `unsafe.Pointer` rule 1 | Misaligned pointer conversion | — | — |
| `unsafe.Pointer` rule 2 | `uintptr` held across GC safepoint | — | — |
| `unsafe.Pointer` rule 3 | Pointer arithmetic past allocation end | — | — |
| Out-of-bounds slice reslice | `s[0:100]` when `cap(s)==4` | — | — |
| Data races | Including channel ordering bugs | — | partial |
| Uninitialized reads | Reading memory before first write | — | — |
| Nil pointer dereference | On uncovered code paths | — | partial |
| Send/close on closed channel | `ch <- v` after `close(ch)` | — | — |
| Double-free | Freeing memory twice | — | — |

## Showcase

The programs in [`testdata/showcase/`](testdata/showcase/) are minimal, self-contained examples that compile cleanly, pass `go vet`, and pass `go test -race` — but Giri detects a real bug in each one. See the [showcase README](testdata/showcase/README.md) for a walkthrough.

### Key Design Decisions

**Shadow Memory** (`pkg/shadow/`): Every allocation in the interpreted program gets an `AllocID` with metadata — provenance, bounds, lifecycle state, and initialization bits. Every pointer carries a `Pointer` struct linking it to its source allocation. This is directly inspired by Miri's allocation tracking.

**Provenance Tracking**: Pointer provenance is transitive. If you take an arena pointer, cast it through `unsafe.Pointer`, store it in an interface, and extract it later — it still knows it came from the arena. This is what makes Giri more powerful than static analysis.

**Composable Detectors** (`pkg/detector/`): Each class of UB is checked by an independent module. You can enable/disable detectors individually, and adding new checks doesn't touch the interpreter core.

**Pluggable Scheduling** (`pkg/scheduler/`): Concurrency bugs depend on execution order. Giri supports multiple scheduling strategies — from deterministic (round-robin) to probabilistic (PCT) — with seeds for reproducible bug reports.

## Usage

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/scttfrdmn/giri/cmd/giri@latest

# Check a package
giri ./...

# Arena safety only
giri -arena ./pkg/allocator

# With PCT scheduling for concurrency bugs
giri -strategy pct -seed 42 -depth 3 ./...

# JSON output for CI
giri -format json ./... > giri-report.json

# SARIF output for GitHub code scanning
giri -format sarif ./... > giri-results.sarif

# Detect uninitialized reads (off by default — slower)
giri -init ./...

# Verbose mode (print every SSA instruction)
giri -v ./cmd/server

# Dump SSA for debugging
giri -dump-ssa ./pkg/mypackage
```

### Arena Programs

Arena programs (`import "arena"`) are detected and analyzed automatically — you do not need to set `GOEXPERIMENT=arenas` before running giri. If the initial load fails because the experiment flag is missing, giri retries with it set automatically.

### CI Integration

Giri exits with code 0 (no violations), 1 (violations found), or 2 (load/internal error), making it suitable as a CI gate.

**GitHub Actions (SARIF upload to code scanning):**

```yaml
- name: Run giri
  run: giri -format sarif ./... > giri-results.sarif || true

- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: giri-results.sarif
    category: giri
```

See [`.github/workflows/sarif.yml`](.github/workflows/sarif.yml) for the full workflow used on this repository.

## Relationship to SafeArena

Giri grew out of [SafeArena](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/safearena)'s `arenacheck` static analyzer. Where arenacheck performs static SSA analysis to approximate provenance, Giri executes the SSA and tracks provenance concretely. This eliminates false positives and handles dynamic dispatch, closures, and interfaces that static analysis can't follow.

SafeArena provides **runtime wrappers** (add safety to your code). Giri provides **interpretive verification** (find bugs in existing code). They're complementary:

| | SafeArena | Giri |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Runtime wrappers | SSA interpretation |
| Requires code changes | Yes (`Ptr[T]`, `Scoped`) | No |
| False positives | None (runtime) | Very low (concrete execution) |
| Performance | Runs at near-native speed | 10-100x slower (interpretation) |
| Scope | Arena safety only | Arena + unsafe + races + bounds |
| When to use | Production code | Testing/CI |
